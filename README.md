# SMASH: Synchronized Many-sided Rowhammer Attacks from JavaScript

Script to trigger (Rowhammer) bit flips on TRR-enabled DDR4 SDRAM through Firefox. Will only work with THP enabled and after having set the target-specific parameters (see comment in source).

The exploitation component (see paper) has been left out.

A demo is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2D4D-kF-ic). The paper (to appear in USENIX Security '21) can be found [here](https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/smash_sec21.pdf) or [here](https://download.vusec.net/papers/smash_sec21.pdf).
